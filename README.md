# network_topology
This is my python script to create a given topology or "topo". Specifically, a topo with 5 hosts and 3 switches. I have named each of these and used PyCharm IDE. Please see the note below for run-time specifications.
NOTE: The script runs by using the following command: "sudo python network_topo.py" (use within mininet VM).

Thanks for taking the time to check out my work!
